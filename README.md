# prework-study-guide
study guide for bootcamp coursework

## Description

this study guide was made to help coding bootcamp students study. my motivation behind this study guide is so that i can easily acces bullet points that were covered in the prework modules. Itll help solve the issue of not having notes neatly organized and readily accesed. in prework we learned about 4 different coding languages, HTML, Git, CSS and JavaScript
